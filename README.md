# Basics

## Insider Version of VS Code

The VS Code team uses the Insiders version to test the latest features and bug fixes of VS Code. You can use this same version by [downloading here](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

* For Early Adopters - Insiders has the most recent code changes and may lead to the occasional broken build.
* Frequent Builds - New builds everyday with the latest bug fixes and features.
* Side-by-side install - Insiders installs next to the Stable build allowing you to use either independently.
